# NOTE
This wound up being a one off thing for practice, so I'm not planning on updating it for fixing it for new atom versions. I think some people made forks so check those out.


# Placeholder-Text
A convenient dummy text palette for Atom.

# Directions

The default keystroke on windows is (ctrl-alt-t), but it can also be accessed via context and package menus.

Doing so will open a select list view to browse defined placeholder text.

# TODO
* Add graphical interface for adding/removing snippets, via serialized options page or something.
* Along with dummy text snippets, have dummy text generation of certain length and format.

# Known Issues
* It throws an error when you either hit the command twice or hit escape while the window is opened and focused. I think it has something to do with my overriding of the view's "cancel" callback (Which I do to prevent having to repopulate the list).

# Examples
Here are some of the defaults I've placed in the data file.

### Body Text
This is the main body text. Here is where we write the major content of the page. Try to keep it concise and relevant. This is what the user will most likely read directly after looking at the title, so it should immediately hook their interest and keep them involved until the end. This is crappy filler text but serves mostly as an example of what you could do with stored bits of filler text. No more having to copy paste from a text file or generator. Immediately have what you need, a mere hotkey away!

### Lorem Ispum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam ut ligula dui. Maecenas in sapien cursus, condimentum nulla vitae, pellentesque metus. Sed accumsan tellus et molestie volutpat. Maecenas feugiat, mi.

### Samuel L. Ipsum
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
